# Powell conjugate directions nonlinear optimization application

This is an optimization course project. The goal of this project was to create an application which is able to find a minimum of a given n-dimensional function using Powell conjugate directions nonlinear optimization method.

### Getting Started

This application is able to find a minimum of given function which satisfies following conditions:
* is 2 up to 10-dimensional
* has at least 1 minimum
* starting point lies in vincinity of a minimum, on a surface with a negative slope

2-dimensional problems have also a heatmap-with-isolines visualization, as well as algorithm steps drawing provided.

## Packages used

* [mXparser](http://mathparser.org/) - The function parser used
